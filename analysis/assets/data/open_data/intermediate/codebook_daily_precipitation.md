## daily_precipitation.csv & daily_precipitation.R

  - **What is this?**: The R scripts and resulting data documenting total daily precipitation in 2019 for 640 weather stations across the US.
  - **Source(s) & Methods**: All of the data used in this story came from the Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN)-Daily [database](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/ghcn-daily-description) and was acquired from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationâ€™s (NOAA) [open data server](ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/by_year/). While this database contains data from thousands of weather stations worldwide, we filtered the data down to only include weather stations with consistent daily precipitation recordings from January 1, 2010 - December 31, 2019. Further, some of these stations were located in mountain ranges or other areas away from cities. To make the comparison to cities like Seattle more relevant, we used [Geocod.io](https://geocod.io/) to find the nearest city or town to the latitude and longitude of each weather station. If no city or town could be located with an Accuracy Score of 0.8 that weather station was excluded. Ultimately, 640 weather stations remained in our analysis and the data for those weather stations is included here, along with the R script to download and filter all of the data.
