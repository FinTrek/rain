  - *Other Notes*: Include any other relevant notes/calculations/code
    here.

  - *Analysis Session Info*: Including any relevant data processing
    scripts is great practice (seriously, good job\! ðŸŽ‰), but for anyone
    who wants to run your script, they need a little more info. At the
    very least, make sure that you include any of your session info, so
    things like:
    
      - What software you are using (including version number)
      - What packages are you using (including version number)
      - anything else that would help someone re-run your analysis given
        only the information/data provided in this repo.
