In fact, I haven’t taken my umbrella outside once since I moved here (and not just because <a href=https://www.notion.so/thepudding/Explainer-of-Seattle-Rain-dba183d1511a484ab3c95398bf73f6ed#12a6ac8258bd40aa97d786991bd05f3b target=_blank>I’d be judged by the locals</a>). I just haven’t felt like I needed it. That’s not to say that it never rains here, of course, but the rain is typically more of a mist or drizzle and an umbrella would be overkill.

First, if you’re used to the summer rain and winter snow of east coast cities, Seattle’s wet winters and dry summers may seem unusual. Particularly because the wet seasons can be <strong>very</strong> wet (I’m looking at you, 30 wet days in <a href=http://komonews.com/weather/scotts-weather-blog/seattle-breaks-record-with-rain-on-30-days-in-a-month>January 2020</a>)."},{"type":"text","value":"Bumbaco continues that our lack of snow may also be to blame. “I think the fact that lowland snow is uncommon here in comparison to much of the rest of the country (due to our mild winter temperatures) plays into the stereotype as well since our winter precipitation falls as rain.” Perhaps when your precipitation falls as snow, it doesn’t feel as wet and is thus less notable than when it falls as rain?"},{"type":"text","value":"Bond also pointed out another feature of Seattle’s wet season: the seemingly never-ending clouds. “After it has rained every day for an extended period, and the sky has been blanketed by clouds for seeming weeks, many newbies [to Seattle] might expect the sun is bound to appear again soon but guess again”. The clouds here may not always predict precipitation, but maybe their ubiquity makes it <em>feel</em> like we’re always on the precipice of a storm."},{"type":"text","value":"At the end of the day, both seem to agree that the mistiness is a part of life in Seattle, even with its overblown reputation. In Bond’s words “a truly enlightened Pacific Northwesterner essentially ignores the rain”. So if you make your way to the Emerald City and don’t want to stick out, leave the umbrella at home."}],"source-hed":"Data Sources","source":"All of the data used in this story came from the Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN)-Daily <a href=https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/ghcn-daily-description target=_blank>database</a> and was acquired from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) <a href=ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/by_year/ target=_blank>open data server</a>. While this database contains data from thousands of weather stations worldwide, we filtered the data down to only include weather stations with consistent daily precipitation recordings from January 1, 2010 - December 31, 2019. Further, some of these stations were located in mountain ranges or other areas away from cities. To make the comparison to cities like Seattle more relevant, we used <a href=https://geocod.io>Geocod.io</a> to find the nearest city or town to the latitude and longitude of each weather station. If no city or town could be located with an Accuracy Score of 0.8 that weather station was excluded. Ultimately, 640 weather stations remained in our analysis.","precip-hed":"Definition of Precipitation","precip":"While this article speaks most frequently about rain, all data presented is a combination of all forms of precipitation. That is, rain, sleet, hail, snow etc. that falls to the ground.
